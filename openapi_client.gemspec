#Checkout.com API Reference

## Introduction Checkout.com provides a collection of APIs that enable you to process and manage payments.    Our APIs accept and return JSON in the HTTP body and return HTTP response codes to indicate errors. You can consume the APIs directly using your favorite HTTP/REST library or make use of one of our <a href=\"https://docs.checkout.com/quickstart/integrate/sdks\" target=\"_blank\">SDKs</a>.    Our unified payments API allows you to accept payments from cards, digital wallets and the most popular alternative payment methods, as well as pay out to a variety of destinations, all using the same integration.  And with our webhook management, events and disputes APIs, you can keep on top of your transactions and react to any chargebacks, keeping your business running smoothly. # Authentication When you sign up for an account, you are given a secret and public API key pair. You authenticate with our API by providing the appropriate key in the request Authorization header.  Never share your secret keys. Keep them guarded and secure.   <!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->
